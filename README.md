# Shot In the Dark Coding Challenge Server

Shot In The Dark is a "battleship" like problem with variable number of targets as well as variable size targets and variable sized boards.

Number of targets, their size and condition are all secret. This increases the complexity for creating a client to play this game and makes it much more challenging to acheive a highly efficient minimum required shot score.

The rules are simple, pick a coordinate, ask if it is a hit or not. 
Person with the lowest number of guesses after all targets are hit completely wins.

Boards can be generated randomly or can be constructed by hand and can be saved and loaded so that tourneyments can be run across the same boards for all contestants.
