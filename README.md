# Shot In the Dark Coding Challenge Server

Shot In The Dark is a "battleship" like problem with variable number of targets as well as variable size targets and variable sized boards.

Number of targets, their size and condition are all secret. This increases the complexity for creating a client to play this game much more challenging to acheive a highly efficient minimum required shot score.
