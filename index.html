<p>Shot In The Dark is a "battleship" like problem with variable number of targets as well as variable size targets and variable sized boards.</p>

<p>Number of targets, their size and condition are all secret. This increases the complexity for creating a client to play this game and makes it much more challenging to acheive a highly efficient minimum required shot score.</p>

<p>The rules are simple, pick a coordinate, ask if it is a hit or not. 
Person with the lowest number of guesses after all targets are destroyed wins.</p>

<p>Boards can be generated randomly or can be constructed by hand and can be saved and loaded so that tourneyments can be run across the same boards for all contestants.</p>
