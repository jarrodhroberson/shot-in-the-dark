{"name":"Shot In The Dark","tagline":"Shot In The Dark Coding Challenge Game Server","body":"# Shot In the Dark Coding Challenge Server\r\n\r\nShot In The Dark is a \"battleship\" like problem with variable number of targets as well as variable size targets and variable sized boards.\r\n\r\nNumber of targets, their size and condition are all secret. This increases the complexity for creating a client to play this game and makes it much more challenging to acheive a highly efficient minimum required shot score.\r\n\r\nThe rules are simple, pick a coordinate, ask if it is a hit or not. \r\nPerson with the lowest number of guesses after all targets are destroyed wins.\r\n\r\nBoards can be generated randomly or can be constructed by hand and can be saved and loaded so that tourneyments can be run across the same boards for all contestants.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
